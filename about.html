<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>

My name is Joseph Sackitey and I have a passion for science, technology, and solving problems. Even from a young age, I loved building things and understanding how the world works. I threw myself into my studies at Prempeh College, majoring in General Science and taking advanced courses in physics, chemistry, biology, and math. 
</p>
<p>Outside of school, 
  I pursued hands-on engineering and programmingng
  projects that have honed my intellectual abilities.
  
</p>
<p>I've  built a range of software applications and web platforms using languages like Python, Flask, JavaScript, and more. From inventory management systems to blogging platforms and task managers, I love bringing ideas to life through code. Solving problems with technology is like a creative puzzle for me.
</p>
<p>
I'm proud that my projects and academics have earned me recognition ranging from my school to the international level. But what drives me forward is always the chance to learn something new, take on an exciting challenge, or use my skills to make a difference in my community. I can't wait to see what opportunities open up next on this journey.
